# Feed Reader Testing Project

#### Front End Nano-Degree

> Fourth project for Udacity Front-End Nano-Degree

### Project Overview

In this project we are given a web-based application that reads RSS feeds. The original developer of this application clearly saw the value in testing, they've already included [Jasmine](http://jasmine.github.io/) and even started writing their first test suite. Our job in this project was to complete the tests to ensure that everything work just fine.
